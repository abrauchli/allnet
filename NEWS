2014/03/25: release 3.0
  Everything on the command line works (pidgin has not been tested yet).

  Major changes from version 2:
    New packet header format, more regular and easier to use
      supports streams and large messages
      acks are end-to-end for encrypted data, and hop-by-hop for broadcast data
    trace program, equivalent of ping and traceroute together
    Allnet Human Readable Addresses (ahra) to subscribe to broadcasts
      -- see doc/ahra/ahra-design, or simply
            bin/allnet-subscribe allnet_hourly_time_server@if_wish.think_past.get_future
         then
            bin/allnet-radio
         for at least an hour
    the implementation has a new directory structure, uses git,
      sourceforge, and automake (thanks mostly to AB) -- see README to build
    xchat and xkey use a different directory structure under ~/.allnet
      -- v2 keys will not work, unless moved around the file system
